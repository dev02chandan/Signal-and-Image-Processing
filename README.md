## Introduction

Signal and image processing is a vast field of study that encompasses techniques used to process, analyze, and interpret signals and images. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks, each covering different fundamental topics and methods within this domain, from the basics of signals to the complexities of image processing algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured with all the Jupyter notebooks located within the `src` directory. Each notebook is named to reflect the topic it covers. For instance:

- `1_Basics_of_Signal_and_Image_Processing.ipynb`
- `2_Signals_and_Operations_on_Signals.ipynb`
- `3_DFT_and_IDFT_with_Twiddle_Factor_Matrix.ipynb`
- `...and so on.`

## Getting Started

To use the notebooks in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/dev02chandan/Signal-and-Image-Processing.git
2. Ensure you have Jupyter installed or use Google Colab to open the notebooks.
3. Start running the notebooks!
